            As a recent Ph.D. student from Santa Clara University, my journey in Computer Science has been marked by a deep dive into AI and agile development. At KellynKai Chinese, as a Full Stack Engineer Intern, we developed innovative solutions and I honed my skills in OpenAI products, particularly in crafting large language models that drive efficiency and growth.

            My academic prowess is complemented by a passion for real-world application, as evidenced by our first-place victory in the Solaris AI GPT-4o vs Gemini Hackathon. There, we built an AI-powered negotiation tool that leveraged the GPT-4o model, integrating cutting-edge technology for practical business use. This blend of theory and practice underscores my commitment to pushing the boundaries of technology and delivering tangible results.
